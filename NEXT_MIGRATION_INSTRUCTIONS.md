# Next.js Migration Instructions

This project has been migrated to Next.js. To complete the final steps of the migration, follow these instructions:

1. Rename `package.next.json` to `package.json` and `tsconfig.next.json` to `tsconfig.json`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Make sure all existing images in `/public/lovable-uploads/` are available in the Next.js public directory
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Migration Status:

✅ Next.js app structure created  
✅ Pages and routes converted to Next.js App Router  
✅ Components updated with "use client" directive where needed  
✅ Links updated from React Router to Next.js  
✅ Layout components implemented  

## Additional Notes:
- Server components are the default in Next.js, so components that need browser APIs use "use client"
- Images use the standard img tag but can be optimized with Next.js Image component in the future
- The Next.js App Router uses a file-based routing system which has been implemented

If you encounter any issues with the migration, check the Next.js documentation at https://nextjs.org/docs
