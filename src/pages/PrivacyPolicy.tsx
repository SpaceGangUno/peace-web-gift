                I understand that health information about you and your health care is personal. I am committed to protecting health
                information about you. I create a record of the care and services you receive from me. I need this record to provide

              <p className="mb-2">The following categories describe different ways that I use and disclose health information.</p>
              
              <h4 className="font-medium mt-4 mb-2">For Treatment Payment, or Health Care Operations:</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Federal privacy rules (regulations) allow health care providers who have direct treatment relationship with the patient/client to use or disclose the patient/client's
                personal health information without the patient's written authorization, to carry out the health care provider's own
                treatment, payment or health care operations. I may also disclose your protected health information for the treatment
                activities of any health care provider. This too can be done without your written authorization. For example, if a
                clinician were to consult with another licensed health care provider about your condition, we would be permitted to
                use and disclose your personal health information, which is otherwise confidential, in order to assist the clinician in
                diagnosis and treatment of your mental health condition.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Disclosures for treatment purposes are not limited to the minimum necessary standard. Because therapists and other
                health care providers need access to the full record and/or full and complete information in order to provide quality
                care. The word "treatment" includes, among other things, the coordination and management of health care providers
                with a third party, consultations between health care providers and referrals of a patient for health care from one
                health care provider to another.
              </p>
              
              <h4 className="font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Lawsuits and Disputes:</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you are involved in a lawsuit, I may disclose health information in response to a court or
                administrative order. I may also disclose health information about your child in response to a subpoena, discovery
                request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made to tell
                you about the request or to obtain an order protecting the information requested.

                request restrictions on disclosures of your PHI to health plans for payment or health care operations
                purposes if the PHI pertains solely to a health care item or a health care service that you have paid for
                out-of-pocket in full.</li>
                <li>The Right to Choose How I Send PHI to You. You have the right to ask me to contact you in a
                specific way (for example, home or office phone) or to send mail to a different address, and I will
                agree to all reasonable requests.</li>
                <li>The Right to See and Get Copies of Your PHI. Other than "psychotherapy notes," you have the right
                to get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other information that I have about you.
                I will provide you with a copy of your record, or a summary of it, if you agree to receive a summary,
                within 30 days of receiving your written request, and I may charge a reasonable, cost based fee for
                doing so.</li>

                <li>The Right to Correct or Update Your PHI. If you believe that there is a mistake in your PHI, or that a
                piece of important information is missing from your PHI, you have the right to request that I correct
                the existing information or add the missing information. I may say "no" to your request, but I will tell
